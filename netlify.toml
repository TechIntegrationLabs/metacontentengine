# ============================================
# PCC (POLYNESIAN CULTURAL CENTER) CLIENT
# ============================================
# To deploy the PCC client, create a separate Netlify site with:
#   - Build command: npx nx build pcc --configuration=production
#   - Publish directory: dist/apps/pcc
#   - Base directory: content-engine/
#
# Or use branch-based deployment with this context:

[context.client-pcc]
  command = "npx nx build pcc --configuration=production"
  publish = "dist/apps/pcc"

  [context.client-pcc.environment]
    VITE_ENVIRONMENT = "production"

# ============================================
# MULTI-CLIENT DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ============================================
# To deploy a different client app, either:
#
# 1. Create a separate Netlify site with env overrides:
#    NETLIFY_BUILD_COMMAND = "npx nx build <client-name> --configuration=production"
#    Set publish directory in Netlify UI to: dist/apps/<client-name>
#
# 2. Or use branch-based deployments:
#    - main branch -> geteducated (default)
#    - client-pcc branch -> PCC client
#
#    Add context block:
#    [context.client-pcc]
#      command = "npx nx build pcc --configuration=production"
#      publish = "dist/apps/pcc"
#
# 3. Or use Netlify's monorepo support with separate netlify.toml
#    per app in apps/<client>/netlify.toml
# ============================================
